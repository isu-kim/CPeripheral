## CPeripheral
This program is for controlling RGB peripheral devices connected to your computer written in C++

**List of fully Supported SDKs**
 - Corsair ICUE SDK
 - Razer Chroma SDK

**List of working SDKs**
 - MSI MysticLight SDK

## Background
I have developed something similar using Python. If you are interested in the project, please check it out [PyPheperial](https://github.com/gooday2die/PyPheperial) (Yes it is spelled wrong.. :b). When I was developing this project, I had a lot of difficulties with SDKs which support only C++. Thus, I have decided to develop a similar project in C++ which happened to be this project. 

For your information, I have some peripheral devices. 

**Corsair**
 - K95 Platinum
 - MM800
 - Glaive
 - Void Pro

**Razer**

 - DeathAdder Elite

**MSI**

 - RTX 2080 TI

Since all the devices are from different manufacturers, they use all different programs to control their RGB lights. Thus I have decided to develop a program which makes it possible for all the RGB lights to be controlled by just one program.

## Features
**List of available features**

 -  Setting same color in all devices.
 -  Syncing rainbow shift in all devices.
 - Syncing breathing effect in all devices

**List of developing features**
